                    location. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Customers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Promotion Product 
                    (depending on their purchase) off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart. Important notice regarding

                    credit equal to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You 
                    will be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product (i.e. the 
                    value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months as the discounted 
                    Eligible Product. The total combined amount charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of the 
                    Eligible Product. Separately, you will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant
